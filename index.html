            Congrats! if you are reading this message it means that I submitted my poorly made website.
            Take a deep breath and prepare yourself.
            <br>
            I may have not finished the full assingment so I apologize.
            <br>
            I am a scientist working for the City of Austin environmental laboratory and I am 
            currently enrolled in a web developer bootcamp at UT to further my career options.
            This website has been difficult to make but I am proud of whatever I submitted at this point.
